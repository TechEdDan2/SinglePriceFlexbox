## My process

For this project, I started by creating the sections I thought I would need to organize the content (container, and three sub divs for the three blocks of content) and then styled it. During the styling process I set up variables.  

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since this is my second FrontEnd Mentor project, I am learning more about the process than about new HTML and CSS; however, I did use variables for the first time, which was really useful.  

### Continued development

I am new to website development, so I am hoping to get better at my workflow and general knowledge. I am also not sure if I am following best practices or the best way to style something. 

### Useful resources

- [HTML_CSS_Help] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Docs 
- [Flexbox Help](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with flexbox. I am sure everyone already uses this website.
